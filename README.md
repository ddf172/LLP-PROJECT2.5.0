Mandelbrot Fractal Generator
Note: This is an extension of the BMP File Analyzer and Processor academic project.

Features
- Generate Mandelbrot fractal images of any specified size
- Save the generated fractals as BMP files
- Utilize custom color mapping for visually appealing results

To generate a Mandelbrot fractal image:
./mandelbrot_generator <width> <height> <path_to_output_bmp>

Limitations
The program currently generates only the classic Mandelbrot set.
Color mapping is basic and may not produce optimal visual results for all image sizes.
